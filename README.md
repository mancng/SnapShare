# SnapShare

This is a chat app for users to send photos in a disposable way. The sender can pick images from their phone photo gallery. The receiver will get a popup notification that an image was received. Once receiver clicks the close button, the image will be deleted from the Parse server. The images are compressed and stored at Parse Server and hosted with Amazon AWS. 

Note, the AWS server hosting this project is turned off at the moment.
